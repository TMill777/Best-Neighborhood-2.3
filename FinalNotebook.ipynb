    "We balanced a priority of safety with the fire incidents and the arrest report, with the last data set of county assets showing that the best neighborhood will have a combination of safety + assets. Fire incidents was a large indicator towards safety in a surrounding area because if theres a high number of fire incidents, it could indicate a couple of things, such as a lackluster fire department or irresponsible people, both of which could negatively impact a neighborhood a lot. We also have the data for arrests in each neighborhood, which is obviously a huge indicator towards neighborhood safety. The safest neighborhoods will have a low arrest number combined with a low fire incident count. However, we didn't just measure safety, and also measured the amount of assets (businesses/schools/healthcare services/etc) that each neighborhood has. A neighborhood could be very safe but doesn't have the necessary assets that truly make it the best neighborhood, so the true best neighborhood will be proficient in all three categories."

    "When it came to fire incidents, I was surprised by the data which I discovered and ranked. Most of the percieved \"best\" neighborhoods in Pittsburgh such as Squirrel Hill and Shadyside were some of the neighborhoods with the highest reported fire incidents. This could be due to a higher population, but the idea of lackluster fire safety is still there. For my notebook, I imported the data and then simply stepped through the data, ranking every neighborhood in the dataset by the total amount of fire incidents. The gap between the top and bottom was a lot larger than I expected, with the most fire incidents being 328 and the least fire incidents simply being 7. I was also able to determine the most common type of fire incident, which ended up being cooking fires followed right by building fires.\n",
